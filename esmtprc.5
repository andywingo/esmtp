.SH NAME
esmtprc
\-
\fBesmtp\fR configuration file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
A \fBesmtp\fR configuration file consists of several options.  The options
format is:

.nf
    \fIkeyword\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.fi

The equal sign is optional and can be replaced by whitespace.  The \fIvalue\fR
may be enclosed in simple or double quotes, in which case special characters
can be escaped as in normal C strings.

Comments are delimited by the '#' character upto the newline character.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBhostname\fR
Set SMTP host and service (port).

The format is:

.nf
    host.example.org[:\fIservice\fR]
.fi

With no whitespace surrounding the colon if service is specified. \fIservice\fR
may be a name from /etc/services or a decimal port number.  If not specified
the port defaults to 587.

Note (from \fBlibESMTP\fR documentation): the default port number is set to
587 since this is the port that should be used for mail submission, see RFC
2476.  By choosing this default now, the API does not change behavior
unexpectedly in the future as use of the new standard becomes commonplace.
The hostport notation simplifies things for the application, the user can
type "localhost:smtp" or "localhost:25" where the application
expects a host name.

.TP
\fBusername\fR
Set the username for authentication with the SMTP server.

Do NOT set the username and password on the system configuration file unless
you are the only user of this machine.  \fBEsmtp\fR is not run with suid
privileges therefore the system configuration file must be readable by
everyone.  If your SMTP server reuquires authentication and you are not the
only user then specify your personal SMTP account details in the user
configuration file.

.TP
\fBpassword\fR
Set the password for authentication with the SMTP server.

.TP
\fBstarttls\fR
Whether to use the StartTLS extension.

It can be one of \fBenabled\fR, \fBdisabled\fR or \fBrequired\fR. It defaults to
\fBdisabled\fR.

.TP
\fBcertificate_passphrase\fR
Set the certificate passphrase for the StartTLS extension.

.TP
\fBidentity\fR
Define an identity.

An identity is a set of options associated with a given address.  For example:

.nf
    identity = myself@somewhere.com
        hostname = smtp.somewhere.com:25
        username = "myself"
        password = "secret"
.fi

Identities are be selected by the address specified in the \fB\-f\fR flag.  You
can have as many you like.

The options in the global section (up to the first \fBidentity\fR option)
constitute the default identity. If no options in the global section are given
then the first defined identity is taken as the default one.

Note that the default identity settings are not shared by the other identities.
Everything (username, password, etc.) must be specified for every identity even
if they don't differ from the default identity.

.TP
\fBmda\fR
Set the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).

The local delivery addresses will be inserted into the MDA command wherever you
place a %T. The mail message's \fBFrom\fR address will be inserted where you
place an %F.

Some common MDAs are "/usr/bin/procmail -d %T",
"/usr/bin/deliver" and "/usr/lib/mail.local %T".
