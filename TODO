To do
~~~~~

  <<esmtp>> already fulfills all my needs, and I don't plan to spend much more
  time on it besides bug fixing.

  Here is a list of what can still be done:

    * Alias expansion.

    * Include simple scripts to queue emails for dial-up connections.

    * In order to facilitate translation, it would be a good idea to run
    debconf-gettextize (from the po-debconf package). See the documentation
    that comes with po-debconf. Don't forget to update Build-depends.
