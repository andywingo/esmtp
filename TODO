To do
~~~~~

  <<esmtp>> already fulfills all my needs, and I don't plan to spend much more
  time on it besides bug fixing.

  Here is a list of what can still be done:

    * Alias expansion.

    * Include simple scripts to queue emails for dial-up connections.

    * In conjunction with "preconnect", a "postconnect" configuration option
      would be a good idea (example: tear down a SSH tunnel).
