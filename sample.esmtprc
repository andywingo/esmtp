# Sample configuration file for ESMTP.
#
# 	José Fonseca

# Set SMTP host and service (port)
#
hostname = localhost:25
#
# This is specified in the format host.example.org[:service] with no whitespace
# surrounding the colon if service is specified. service may be a name from
# /etc/services or a decimal port number. If not specified the port defaults to
# 587.
#
# NOTE (from libESMTP documentation): The default port number is set to 587
# since this is the port that should be used for mail submission, see RFC 2476.
# By choosing this default now, the API does not change behaviour unexpectedly
# in the future as use of the new standard becomes commonplace. The hostport
# nototion simplifies things for the application, the user can type
# localhost:smtp or localhost:25 where the application expects a host name. 

# Set the user name
#
username = "USERNAME"
#
# Note that the equal and quotes are optional but can be helpful in certain
# circumstances.

# Set the password
password = "PASSWORD"

# Use the Starttls
#
#starttls = disabled
#
# It can be one of "enabled", "disabled" or "required". It defaults to
# disabled.

# Set the certificate passphrase
#
#certificate_passphrase = "CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE"


# Same as above but for a different identity which can be selected with the
# '-f' flag. You can have as many you like.
#
identity myself@somewhere.com
	hostname smtp.somewhere.com:25
	username "myself"
	password "secret"
	#starttls = disabled
#
# NOTE: the default indentity settings aren't shared by the other identities.
# Everything (username, password, etc.) must be specified for every identity
# even if they don't differ from the default identity.
