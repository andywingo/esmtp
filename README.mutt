To use ESMTP with mutt add the following line

	set sendmail="/path/to/esmtp"

to your ~/.muttrc and create a ~/.esmtprc (see the included sample.esmtprc 
for an example.)

For debugging purposes you may prefer using the follwing shell script. 

	#!/bin/sh

	LOGFILE=/tmp/esmtp.log

	echo $0 $@ > $LOGFILE

	/path/to/esmtp -v $@ >> $LOGFILE

	exit $?

Save it as esmtp.sh and put in your ~/.muttrc

	set sendmail="/path/to/esmtp.sh"

instead.
