To use ESMTP with mutt add the following line

	set sendmail="/path/to/esmtp"

to your ~/.muttrc and create a ~/.esmtprc (see the included sample.esmtprc for
an example.)

ESMTP supports SENDMAIL envelope sender '-f' flag, so don't forget to add

	set envelope_from=yes

as well.

For debugging purposes you may prefer to put in your ~/.muttrc

	set sendmail="/path/to/esmtp -X /tmp/esmtp.log"

instead.
