ESMTP is a user configurable relay-only Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) with a
sendmail-compatible syntax. It's based on libESMTP supporting the AUTH
(including the CRAM-MD5 and NTLM SASL mechanisms) and the StartTLS SMTP
extensions.

See ESMTP home page http://esmtp.sourceforge.net/ for more information.
